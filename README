Come to the RailsConf 2018 Music Jam!

Bring an instrument (or your voice) and let’s make music!

Many Rails developers are also musicians. Whether you play jazz, rock, blues, pop, or whatever the case may be, come along and meet and play with other musical developers. Don’t worry if you can’t bring your own instrument, stop by anyway. There will be a full set of drums, bass, and guitars thanks to DevRelate.io.
